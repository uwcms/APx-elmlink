# Files in this directory should be named identical to the socket they manage.
#
# These files can contain any number of lines which start with '#' or are blank.
#
# They should contain one line which provides a user name (not id), group name
# (not id), and mode (octal only), in the following manner:
#
# root wheel 0770
#
# This will define the permissions set by the ELMLink daemon when a matching
# socket is created.
